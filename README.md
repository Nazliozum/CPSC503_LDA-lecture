# CPSC 503 - Pedagogical Project

This repository holds all learning material prepared for the pedagogical project as part of the CSPC 503 (Spring 2019) course at UBC.

## Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

Latent Dirichlet Allocation model (LDA; Blei et al. 2003) is a hierarchical Bayesian approach to topic modelling that describes a generative process of document creation. The goal of LDA is to infer topics as latent variables from the observed distribution of words in each document.

### Why learn LDA?

- Within the list of topic modelling methods, LDA is the most widely used one, especially in research disciplines relying heavily on textual data to extract information.
- In the computer science literature, the research paper by Blei et al. (2003) that proposed LDA for the first time is one of the most cited papers in machine learning. 

## Main Content

In this repo, you can find:

- the [lecture slides](),
- the [final report]() explaining in detail the project goals and content,
- a [simple demonstration]() of LDA in R language, and
- an [assignment]() designed to assess the learning experience of students

## Resources

There are many great resources online to learn and apply LDA. Needless to say, the best resource to start with is the [Blei et al. (2003)](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf) article that introduced the LDA algorithm to the literature. 

Below is a list of other resources that have been greatly helpful in preparing the material within this repository.

**For understanding LDA:**

- [Video lectures](http://videolectures.net/mlss09uk_blei_tm/) by David Blei at Cambridge University in 2009

- Topic modelling sections of the [CPSC 540: Machine Learning](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Courses/540-W18/L33.pdf) slides by Mark Schmidt

- [Introduction to Latent Dirichlet Allocation](http://blog.echen.me/2011/08/22/introduction-to-latent-dirichlet-allocation/) on Edwin Chen's blog for a fun and intuitive explanation of LDA

**For applying LDA:**
