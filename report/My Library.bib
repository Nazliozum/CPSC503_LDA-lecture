	abstract = {Information Technology (IT) investments are the largest capital budgeting item in most U.S. firms. Thus, there is significant scholarly interest in understanding the relationship between IT investments and firm performance. However, findings to date remain mixed: while some studies find a positive relationship between IT investments and firm performance, others fail to find any significant relationships at all. One possible reason for this may be that most studies conceptualize and measure firm performance in terms of returns—but ignore risk. Although risk is also an important aspect of firm performance, and there are tradeoffs between risks and returns, most IS studies have not included risk in examining the relationship between IT investments and firm performance. Focusing only on the return implications of IT ignores risk/return tradeoffs and the possibility that IT can influence the risk/return positions of firms. In this study, we build on and extend the economic theory of complementarities to explain how and why IT influences risk/return relations of firms. We discuss how the incorporation of risk into the analysis of performance effects of IT provides new insights for theory and practice.},

Past rational and empirical explorations of this truism found little support for it. A broader empirical approach was taken for the study reported here; correspondence between lab and field was compared across a broad range of domains, including aggression, helping, leadership style, social loafing, self-efficacy, depression, and memory, among others. Correspondence between lab- and field-based effect sizes of conceptually similar independent and dependent variables was considerable. In brief, the psychological laboratory has generally produced psychological truths, rather than trivialities. These same data suggest that a companion truism about field studies in psychology—that they are generally low on internal validity—is also false.},

	abstract = {IT internal controls are an important component of an organization's arsenal of internal controls. Upon conceptualizing failures of operational IT systems, or what we call IT operational risk events, as signals of IT internal control weaknesses, we theorize about these events' impact on internal control objectives in general and about how this impact is inﬂuenced by the regulatory environment in particular. We then perform an event study to examine the economic impact of a diversiﬁed sample of IT operational risk events from the U.S. ﬁnancial services industry during 1985–2009. We speciﬁcally test the impact of contextual factors on the degree of this effect, including the events' target (conﬁdentiality, integrity, or availability of IT assets), the source of disclosure (regulatory or voluntary), the enactment of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, and ﬁrm-speciﬁc attributes. We ﬁnd that investors penalize ﬁrms most strongly for experiencing events that compromise the availability of IT systems, consistent with our prediction that these events more negatively impact the reliability of ﬁnancial reporting and the efﬁciency and effectiveness of operations. This result contrasts extant empirical studies that are predominantly concerned with information and security breaches. We ﬁnd also that investors' penalty is the strongest for ﬁrms experiencing IT operational risk events that occurred after the passing of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act or were disclosed by a regulatory body. Finally, the market reaction is shown to be stronger for ﬁrms with high growth potential, ﬁrms that are larger, riskier, and are in the banking sector. Implications for research and practice are discussed along with directions for future research.},

Our sample consists of 213 newspaper reports of IT failures by publicly traded ﬁrms, which occurred during a 10-year period. The ﬁndings show that IT failures result in a 2\% average cumulative abnormal drop in stock prices over a 2-day event window. The results also reveal that the market responds more negatively to implementation failures affecting new systems than to operating failures involving current systems. Further, the study demonstrates that more severe IT failures result in a greater decline in ﬁrm value and that ﬁrms with a history of IT failures suffer a greater negative impact.

Proposal of an eight-dimensional framework for opportunities to add value to a core product or service. Proposed that products that customers purchase are actually a bundle of product and augmenting services that facilitate the use of that product and/or add value to the product offering. No theory or empirical results proffered. As with Levitt (1980), proposed that customers gain value from services that provide additional value to a core product. Kotler (1997) further adds that there is a difference between the customer goal (mixing a drink) and the physical product (the blender). No theory or empirical results proffered. Proposed functionality as a broad-level construct describing the general effectiveness of organizational systems (e.g., ERP). Functionality was deﬁned as a system’s capability to give users what they want and to help the organization meet its strategic objectives.

Conceived and analyzed (service) functionality as a multidimensional construct within the context of consumer e-business. Developed and validated measures for the various facets of (service) functionality as perceived by customers. Atomic-level descriptive analysis of website features that deliver customer services. Compared two prevailing websites using a list of 50 functional requirements, Analyzed the relationship between Lovelock’s (1994) supplementary services and customer needs in the context of consumer websites. Supplementary services were found to be a source of interaction value. Proposed a ﬁve-stage service model describing how ﬁrms evolve service provision over time. Data from both ﬁrm and industry levels suggest that online ﬁrms are at a nascent stage of service development.},

We examined the impact of security breaches of US ﬁrms, as measured by their impact on the ﬁrm’s market value. Data on security breaches were collected over the period 2004–2008. Reports and news articles corresponding to these breaches were obtained from public sources. Using event-study methodology, we estimate the impact of security breaches on the market value of publicly traded ﬁrms. Daily stock returns for ﬁrms impacted were obtained. Our results indicated that, on average, the announcement of a corporate security breach had a negative impact of about 1\% of the market value of the ﬁrm during the days surrounding the event.},

	abstract = {Behavioral scientists routinely publish broad claims about human psychology and behavior in the world’s top journals based on samples drawn entirely from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. Researchers – often implicitly – assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these “standard subjects” are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justiﬁed? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species – frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The ﬁndings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could ﬁnd for generalizing about humans. Many of these ﬁndings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior – hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.},

	abstract = {This study documents variation across industries in creditors’ perceptions of the risk of information technology (IT) investments. The associations we document between IT investments and both initial bond ratings and yield spreads suggest that credit-rating agencies and bond investors consider IT investments in automate and informate industries less risky than those in transform industries. We document that IT investments are associated with more volatile future cash flows in transform industries than in automate or informate industries. The findings indicate that bond investors prefer IT investments in automate industries, where the cash flow payoffs to IT investment are smaller but more stable than in transform industries. Overall, these findings provide the important insight that bondholders’ perceptions of IT investments vary across industries based on bondholders’ aversion to the riskiness and the lack of collateralizability of IT investments. Senior managers should recognize that IT investments have implications for both operational performance and financing costs (e.g., costs of debt) of the firm, and they should consider the potential financial benefits of increased IT capabilities, such as the willingness of corporate bond investors to accept lower financing costs.},

	abstract = {A fundamental dilemma confronts retailers with stand-alone sites on the World Wide Web and those attempting to build electronic malls for delivery via the Internet, online services, or interactive television (Alba et al. 1997). For consumers, the main potential advantage of electronic shopping over other channels is a reduction in search costs for products and product-related information. Retailers, however, fear that such lowering of consumers' search costs will intensify competition and lower margins by expanding the scope of competition from local to national and international. Some retailers' electronic offerings have been constructed to thwart comparison shopping and to ward off price competition, dimming the appeal of many initial electronic shopping services. Ceteris paribus, if electronic shopping lowers the cost of acquiring price information, it should increase price sensitivity, just as is the case for price advertising. In a similar vein, though, electronic shopping can lower the cost of search for quality information. Most analyses ignore the offsetting potential of the latter effect to lower price sensitivity in the current period. They also ignore the potential of maximally transparent shopping systems to produce welfare gains that give consumers a long-term reason to give repeat business to electronic merchants (cf. Alba et al. 1997, Bakos 1997).},

	abstract = {Data breach incidents are on the rise, and have resulted in severe financial and legal implications for the affected organizations. We apply the opportunity theory of crime, the institutional anomie theory, and institutional theory to identify factors that could increase or decrease the contextual risk of data breach. We investigate the risk of data breach in the context of an organization’s physical location, its primary industry, and the type of data breach that it may have suffered in the past. Given the location of an organization, the study finds support for application of the opportunity theory of crime and the institutional anomie theory in estimating the risk of data breach incidents within a state. In the context of the primary industry in which an organization operates, we find support for the institutional theory and the opportunity theory of crime in estimating risk of data breach incidents within an industry. Interestingly though, support for the opportunity theory of crime is partial. We find that investment in information technology (IT) security corresponds to a higher risk of data breach incidents within both a state and an industry, a result contrary to the one predicted by the opportunity theory of crime. A possible explanation for the contradiction is that investments in IT security are not being spent on the right kind of data security controls, a fact supported by evidence from the industry. The work has theoretical and practical implications. Theories from criminology are used to identify the risk factors of data breach incidents and the magnitude of their impact on the risk of data breach. Insights from the study can help IT security practitioners to assess the risk environment of their firm (in terms of data breaches) based on the firm’s location, its industry sector, and the kind of breaches that the firm may typically be prone to.},

Sentiment can be characterized as positive or negative evaluation expressed through language. Common applications of sentiment analysis include the automatic determination of whether a review posted online (of a movie, a book, or a consumer product) is positive or negative toward the item being reviewed. Sentiment analysis is now a common tool in the repertoire of social media analysis carried out by companies, marketers, and political analysts. Research on sentiment analysis extracts information from positive and negative words in text, from the context of those words, and from the linguistic structure of the text. This brief review examines in particular the contributions that linguistic knowledge can make to the task of automatically determining sentiment.},

Thus, there is significant scholarly interest in understanding the relationship between IT investments and firm performance. However, findings to date remain mixed: while some studies find a positive relationship between IT investments and firm performance, others fail to find any significant relationships at all. One possible reason for this may be that most studies conceptualize and measure firm performance in terms of returns—but ignore risk. Although risk is also an important aspect of firm performance, and there are tradeoffs between risks and returns, most IS studies have not included risk in examining the relationship between IT investments and firm performance. Focusing only on the return implications of IT ignores risk/return tradeoffs and the possibility that IT can influence the risk/return positions of firms. In this study, we build on and extend the economic theory of complementarities to explain how and why IT influences risk/return relations of firms. We discuss how the incorporation of risk into the analysis of performance effects of IT provides new insights for theory and practice.},

This paper examines the IT literature, develops an integrative, resource-based theoretical framework, and presents results from a new empirical study in the retail industry. The findings show that ITs alone have not produced sustainable performance advantages in the retail industry, but that some firms have gained advantages by using ITs to leverage intangible, complementary human and business resources such as flexible culture, strategic planning-IT integration, and supplier relationships. The results support the resource-based approach, and help to explain why some firms outperform others using the same ITs, and why successful IT users often fail to sustain IT-based competitive advantages.},

	abstract = {By analyzing evidence of stock returns using a sophisticated market model over a long period and over two distinct and naturally arising sub-periods, this study helps resolve conﬂicting evidence from previous studies concerning the effect of information security breaches on market returns of ﬁrms. This study has three major ﬁndings. First, the impact of the broad class of information security breaches on stock market returns of ﬁrms is signiﬁcant. Second, when breaches are classiﬁed by their primary effect in terms of (i) conﬁdentiality, (ii) availability or (iii) integrity, attacks associated with breaches of availability are seen to have the greatest negative effect on stock market returns. Third, there has been a signiﬁcant downward shift in the impact of the security breaches in the sub-period following the 9/11/2001 attacks versus the impact in the pre-9/11 period. Apparently, with increased media reporting of information security breaches without apparent devastating effects on targeted corporations, investors lowered their assessment of the costs of such breaches. Two possible reasons for this downward shift are (1) more effective remediation and disaster recovery and (2) a perceived decrease in the tendency of customers to refrain from doing business with ﬁrms experiencing an information security breach.},

They exploit a natural experiment and use individual customer transaction data from the retailer to conduct a detailed and systematic empirical examination of the effects of a DBA on customer spending and channel migration behavior. To identify the effects, the authors compare the change in customer behavior before and after the DBA between a treatment group (customers whose information is breached) and a control group (customers whose information is not breached) using the difference-in-differences modeling framework. They ﬁnd that although the data breach results in a signiﬁcant decrease in customer spending, customers of the ﬁrm migrate from the breached to the unbreached channels of the retailer. The ﬁndings further reﬂect that customers with a higher retailer patronage are more forgiving because the negative effects of the DBA are lower for customers with a higher level of patronage. The authors propose and empirically test for the role of customer data vulnerability as the behavioral mechanism that drives customer behavior subsequent to a DBA. The authors offer prescriptions for managers on how to engage with customers following DBAs.},

The self-regulation paradigm fails to reinforce individuals’ right to information and foster proactive risk management as incident-related information is communicated informally and on a voluntary basis. Lately (April 2016) the European Parliament adopted a reformed General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which regulates data breach notification. This paper analyzes the current status in information security incident management, describes the data breach notification mandate introduced by the GDPR and discusses its impact on the accountability and transparency of organisations, the amplification of the security function in organisations and the security market and the reinforcement of situational awareness. This paper also identifies enablers and barriers to compliance and highlights the key challenges that governments and organisations need to address for effective incident management, in the context of the new regulation paradigm.},

	abstract = {[Many organizations recognize that their employees, who are often considered the weakest link in information security, can also be great assets in the effort to reduce risk related to information security. Since employees who comply with the information security rules and regulations of the organization are the key to strengthening information security, understanding compliance behavior is crucial for organizations that want to leverage their human capital. This research identifies the antecedents of employee compliance with the information security policy (ISP) of an organization. Specifically, we investigate the rationality-based factors that drive an employee to comply with requirements of the ISP with regard to protecting the organization's information and technology resources. Drawing on the theory of planned behavior, we posit that, along with normative belief and self-efficacy, an employee's attitude toward compliance determines intention to comply with the ISP. As a key contribution, we posit that an employee's attitude is influenced by benefit of compliance, cost of compliance, and cost of noncompliance, which are beliefs about the overall assessment of consequences of compliance or noncompliance. We then postulate that these beliefs are shaped by the employee's outcome beliefs concerning the events that follow compliance or noncompliance: benefit of compliance is shaped by intrinsic benefit, safety of resources, and rewards, while cost of compliance is shaped by work impediment; and cost of noncompliance is shaped by intrinsic cost, vulnerability of resources, and sanctions. We also investigate the impact of information security awareness (ISA) on outcome beliefs and an employee's attitude toward compliance with the ISP. Our results show that an employee's intention to comply with the ISP is significantly influenced by attitude, normative beliefs, and self-efficacy to comply. Outcome beliefs significantly affect beliefs about overall assessment of consequences, and they, in turn, significantly affect an employee's attitude. Furthermore, ISA positively affects both attitude and outcome beliefs. As the importance of employees' following their organizations' information security rules and regulations increases, our study sheds light on the role of ISA and compliance-related beliefs in an organization's efforts to encourage compliance.]},

Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and stream-lined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of.98 for usefulness and.94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r=.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.]},

	abstract = {Clinical intelligence about a patient’s risk of future adverse health events can support clinical decision making in personalized and preventive care. Healthcare predictive analytics using electronic health records offers a promising direction to address the challenging tasks of risk profiling. Patients with chronic diseases often face risks of not just one, but an array of adverse health events. However, existing risk models typically focus on one specific event and do not predict multiple outcomes. To attain enhanced risk profiling, we adopt the design science paradigm and propose a principled approach called Bayesian multitask learning (BMTL). Considering the model development for an event as a single task, our BMTL approach is to coordinate a set of baseline models—one for each event—and communicate training information across the models. The BMTL approach allows healthcare providers to achieve multifaceted risk profiling and model an arbitrary number of events simultaneously. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that the BMTL approach attains an improved predictive performance when compared with the alternatives that model multiple events separately. We also find that, in most cases, the BMTL approach significantly outperforms existing multitask learning techniques. More importantly, our analysis shows that the BMTL approach can create significant potential impacts on clinical practice in reducing the failures and delays in preventive interventions. We discuss several implications of this study for health IT, big data and predictive analytics, and design science research.},

	abstract = {We consider an online retailer facing heterogeneous customers with initially unknown product preferences. Customers are characterized by a diverse set of demographic and transactional attributes. The retailer can personalize the customers’ assortment oﬀerings based on available proﬁle information to maximize cumulative revenue. To that end, the retailer must estimate customer preferences by observing transaction data. This, however, may require a considerable amount of data and time given the broad range of customer proﬁles and large number of products available. At the same time, the retailer can aggregate (pool) purchasing information among customers with similar product preferences to expedite the learning process. We propose a dynamic clustering policy that estimates customer preferences by adaptively adjusting customer segments (clusters of customers with similar preferences) as more transaction information becomes available. We test the proposed approach with a case study based on a data set from a large Chilean retailer. The case study suggests that the beneﬁts of the dynamic clustering policy under the MNL model can be substantial and result (on average) in more than 37\% additional transactions compared to a data-intensive policy that treats customers independently and in more than 27\% additional transactions compared to a linear-utility policy that assumes that product mean utilities are linear functions of available customer attributes. We support the insights derived from the numerical experiments by analytically characterizing settings in which pooling transaction information is beneﬁcial for the retailer, in a simpliﬁed version of the problem. We also show that there are diminishing marginal returns to pooling information from an increasing number of customers.},

	abstract = {Technology implementation at the individual level within an organization, after the organization has adopted the technology, has been an ongoing challenge in every ﬁeld. In this study, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian learning model to examine the impact of social learning, through both targeted early adopter eﬀects and general peer eﬀects, and experiential learning on the information technology implementation process by physicians in a community health system. Our unique data allow us to disentangle the most common and challenging endogeneity issues associated with most social inﬂuence studies. We ﬁnd that the experiential learning signal is more accurate than the social learning signals in the technology implementation process; and, between the two types of social learning signals studied here, targeted early adopter eﬀects are much more informative than general peer eﬀects. Furthermore, we experiment with several policy simulations to illustrate and quantify the two diﬀerent types of social inﬂuence on this implementation process. The simulation results suggest that maintaining consistency in technology usage by targeted early adopters is more eﬀective than increasing the frequency of their technology usage in reducing their colleagues’ perceptions of uncertainty about the new technology. More speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that technology implementation probability would increase: (a) by 15\%, on average, by adding a targeted early adopter to a group without early adopters; (b) by 25\% by adding peer eﬀects to solo users; and (c) by 47\% by adding early adopter eﬀects to solo users. The model can be adapted and generalized to other similar settings that examine social inﬂuence on the technology implementation process and also provide quantiﬁable measures of the improvements that the interventions may produce.},

	abstract = {Marketing managers are responsible for understanding and predicting customer purchasing activity. This task is complicated by a lack of knowledge of all of the calendar time events that inﬂuence purchase timing. Yet, isolating calendar time variability from the natural ebb and ﬂow of purchasing is important for accurately assessing the inﬂuence of calendar time shocks to the spending process, and for uncovering the customer-level purchasing patterns that robustly predict future spending. A comprehensive understanding of purchasing dynamics therefore requires a model that ﬂexibly integrates known and unknown calendar time determinants of purchasing with individual-level predictors such as interpurchase time, customer lifetime, and number of past purchases. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian nonparametric framework based on Gaussian process priors, which integrates these two sets of predictors by modeling both through latent functions that jointly determine purchase propensity. The estimates of these latent functions yield a visual representation of purchasing dynamics, which we call the model-based dashboard, that provides a nuanced decomposition of spending patterns. We show the utility of this framework through an application to purchasing in free-to-play mobile video games. Moreover, we show that in forecasting future spending, our model outperforms existing benchmarks.},

	abstract = {While the growth of the mobile apps market has created signiﬁcant market opportunities and economic incentives for mobile app developers to innovate, it has also inevitably invited other developers to create rip-oﬀs. Practitioners and developers of original apps claim that copycats steal the original app’s idea and potential demand, and have called for app platforms to take action against such copycats. Surprisingly, however, there has been little rigorous research analyzing whether and how copycats aﬀect an original app’s demand. The primary deterrent to such research is the lack of an objective way to identify whether an app is a copycat or an original. Using a combination of machine learning techniques such as natural language processing, latent semantic analysis, network-based clustering, and image analysis, we propose a method to identify apps as original or copycat and detect two types of copycats: deceptive and nondeceptive. Based on the detection results, we conduct an econometric analysis to determine the impact of copycat apps on the demand for the original apps on a sample of 10,100 action game apps by 5,141 developers that were released in the iOS App Store over ﬁve years. Our results indicate that the eﬀect of a speciﬁc copycat on an original app’s demand is determined by the quality and level of deceptiveness of the copycat. High-quality nondeceptive copycats negatively aﬀect demand for the originals. By contrast, low-quality, deceptive copycats positively aﬀect demand for the originals. Results indicate that in aggregate the impact of copycats on the demand of original mobile apps is statistically insigniﬁcant. Our study contributes to the growing literature on mobile app consumption by presenting a method to identify copycats and providing evidence of the impact of copycats on an original app’s demand.},

A large empirical data set was collected, which included quantitative financial attributes for fraudulent and nonfraudulent public companies. Support vector machines using the financial kernel correctly labeled 80\% of the fraudulent cases and 90.6\% of the nonfraudulent cases on a holdout set. Furthermore, we replicate other leading fraud research studies using our data and find that our method has the highest accuracy on fraudulent cases and competitive accuracy on nonfraudulent cases. The results validate the financial kernel together with support vector machines as a useful method for discriminating between fraudulent and nonfraudulent companies using only publicly available quantitative financial attributes. The results also show that the methodology has predictive value because, using only historical data, it was able to distinguish fraudulent from nonfraudulent companies in subsequent years.]},

In this work we present a new set of operational capabilities to address the threat posed by online extremists in social networks. We use thousands of Twitter accounts related to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to develop behavioral models for these users—in particular, what their accounts look like and with whom they connect. We use these models to track existing extremist users by identifying pairs of accounts belonging to the same user. We then present a model for eﬃciently searching the social network to ﬁnd suspended users’ new accounts based on a variant of the classic Pólya’s urn setup. We ﬁnd a simple characterization of the optimal search policy for this model under fairly general conditions. Our urn model and main theoretical results generalize easily to search problems in other ﬁelds.},

	abstract = {Tracking a user’s online browsing behavior to target them with relevant ads has become pervasive. There is an ongoing debate about the value of such tracking and the associated loss of privacy experienced by users. We inform this debate by quantifying the value of using different kinds of potentially intrusive information in targeted advertising. We collect a large proprietary dataset with over 1.3 million individual impression-bid-level observations. The data has detailed cookie information, as well as the bids placed by the firm for serving ad impressions. We also know whether a user saw the ad and whether a purchased occurred. First, we find that using more information from cookies increases the accuracy of prediction of purchases, but at a decreasing rate. We also find that firm’s bidding decision (how much to bid for an ad) can be accurately predicted by cookie information. We then estimate the effect of an ad on a user’s purchase probability. In particular, we examine whether users who have a high baseline purchase probability are also more likely to be influenced by ads. We find that on average ads do not have a statistically significant impact on purchase probabilities of consumers. However, individuals who have a high baseline purchase probability, do respond positively to ads and ads can increase their purchase probability by up to 2.7 percentage points. To overcome potential endogeneity in ad placement, we use an instrumental variable and find that these results are robust. Finally, we simulate different policy regimes by restricting different kinds of user information from being used for targeted advertising and quantify the impact such restrictions have on sales. We find that restricting more intrusive variables for targeting lowers ad effectiveness and leads to fewer potential purchases.},

When compared with existent methods, our approach is scalable for large datasets and provides finer granularity on quantifying firms’ positions in the spaces of product, market, and technology. We then validate our business proximity measure in the context of industry intelligence and show the measure’s effectiveness in an empirical application of analyzing mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. high technology industry. Based on the research, we also build a cloud-based information system to facilitate competitive intelligence on the high technology industry.},

However, the level of actual abstraction as measured by novel phrases that do not appear in the source document remains low in existing approaches. We propose two techniques to improve the level of abstraction of generated summaries. First, we decompose the decoder into a contextual network that retrieves relevant parts of the source document, and a pretrained language model that incorporates prior knowledge about language generation. Second, we propose a novelty metric that is optimized directly through policy learning to encourage the generation of novel phrases. Our model achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art models, as determined by ROUGE scores and human evaluations, while achieving a significantly higher level of abstraction as measured by n-gram overlap with the source document.},

While many studies have investigated information privacy as an individual, sectoral, or national level phenomenon, there is a gap in our understanding of organizational approaches to developing and implementing policies and programs to manage customer information privacy. Information systems research lack theory to explain firm level information privacy behaviors. This article argues for an expanded repertoire of theories to be applied to investigating information privacy, especially the role that the pursuit of competitive necessity versus competitive advantage plays in explaining organizational level behavior. The authors outline how the Institutional Approach (IA) and the Resource-Based View (RBV) of the firm offer compelling theoretical explanations for firms' behaviors and should be applied to privacy research within the information systems area.},

There is a substantial literature on ethical issues surrounding computing and information technology in the contemporary world, but much of this work is not published nor widely cited in the mainstream IS literature. The purpose of this paper is to offer one contribution to an increased emphasis on ethics in the IS field. The distinctive contribution is a focus on Habermas's discourse ethics. After outlining some traditional theories of ethics and morality, the literature on IS and ethics is reviewed, and then the paper details the development of discourse ethics. Discourse ethics is different from other approaches to ethics as it is grounded in actual debates between those affected by decisions and proposals. Recognizing that the theory could be considered rather abstract, the paper discusses the need to pragmatize discourse ethics for the IS field through, for example, the use of existing techniques such as soft systems methodology. In addition, the practical potential of the theory is illustrated through a discussion of its application to specific IS topic areas including Web 2.0, open source software, the digital divide, and the UK biometric identity card scheme. The final section summarizes ways in which the paper could be used in IS research, teaching, and practice.},

This paper develops a model of normative issues ranging from moral intuition and explicit morality to ethical theory and meta-ethical reflection. After showing that this normative model is relevant to IS and that it allows an improved understanding of normative issues, the paper discusses these levels of normativity in the context of two of the most prominent normative topics in IS: Privacy and intellectual property. The paper then suggests that a more explicit understanding of the different aspects of normativity would benefit IS research. This would leverage the traditional empirical strengths of IS research and use them to develop research that is relevant beyond the boundaries of the discipline. Such broader relevance could be aimed at the reference disciplines. In particular, moral philosophy could benefit from understanding information technology and its role in organizations in more detail. It could, furthermore, inform policy makers who are increasingly called on to regulate new information technologies.},

Because consumers are vulnerable in their dealings with businesses due to a lack of information about and an inability to control the subsequent use of their personal information, we argue that organizations have a moral responsibility to these individuals to avoid causing harm and to take reasonable precautions toward that end. We further argue that firms can enhance their privacy programs by moving beyond merely complying with laws and other regulations and creating a culture of integrity that combines a concern for the law with an emphasis on managerial responsibility for the firm's organizational privacy behaviors. We use two high-profile data breaches experienced by two U.S. companies, ChoicePoint and TJX, to illustrate our arguments for enhancing organizational level privacy programs based on ethical reasoning. In doing so, this paper contributes to the dearth of prior organizational-level privacy research, which has largely overlooked ethical issues or the personal harms often caused by privacy violations.

Papers provide diverse and sometimes non-overlapping motivations for interpretability, and offer myriad notions of what attributes render models interpretable. Despite this ambiguity, many papers proclaim interpretability axiomatically, absent further explanation. In this paper, we seek to refine the discourse on interpretability. First, we examine the motivations underlying interest in interpretability, finding them to be diverse and occasionally discordant. Then, we address model properties and techniques thought to confer interpretability, identifying transparency to humans and post-hoc explanations as competing notions. Throughout, we discuss the feasibility and desirability of different notions, and question the oft-made assertions that linear models are interpretable and that deep neural networks are not.},

	abstract = {Word of mouth (WOM) plays an increasingly important role in shaping consumers’ behavior and preferences. In this paper, we examine whether latent personality traits of online users accentuate or attenuate the eﬀectiveness of WOM in social media platforms. To answer this question, we leverage machine-learning methods in combination with econometric techniques utilizing a novel quasi-experiment. Our analysis yields two main results. First, there is a positive and statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect of the level of personality similarity between two social media users on the likelihood of a subsequent purchase from a recipient of a WOM message after exposure to the WOM message of the sender. In particular, exposure to WOM messages from similar users in terms of personality, rather than dissimilar users, increases the likelihood of a postpurchase by 47.58\%. Second, there are statistically signiﬁcant eﬀects of speciﬁc pairwise combinations of personality characteristics of senders and recipients of WOM messages on the eﬀectiveness of WOM. For instance, introverted users are responsive to WOM, in contrast to extroverted users. Besides this, agreeable, conscientious, and open social media users are more eﬀective disseminators of WOM. In addition, WOM originating from users with low levels of emotional range aﬀects similar users, whereas for high levels of emotional range, increased similarity usually has the opposite eﬀect. The examined eﬀects are also of significant economic importance, as, for instance, a WOM message from an extrovert user to an introvert peer increases the likelihood of a subsequent purchase by 71.28\%. Our ﬁndings are robust to several alternative methods and speciﬁcations, such as controlling for latent user homophily and network structure roles based on deep-learning models. By extending the characteristics that have been theorized to aﬀect the eﬀectiveness of WOM from the observable to the latent space, tapping into users’ latent personality characteristics, and illustrating how companies can leverage the abundance of unstructured data in social media, our paper provides actionable insights regarding the future potential of social media advertising and advanced microtargeting based on big data and deep learning.},

This paper presents an explainable, mixed-initiative topic modeling framework that integrates speculative execution into the algorithmic decisionmaking process. Our approach visualizes the model-space of our novel incremental hierarchical topic modeling algorithm, unveiling its inner-workings. We support the active incorporation of the user’s domain knowledge in every step through explicit model manipulation interactions. In addition, users can initialize the model with expected topic seeds, the backbone priors. For a more targeted optimization, the modeling process automatically triggers a speculative execution of various optimization strategies, and requests feedback whenever the measured model quality deteriorates. Users compare the proposed optimizations to the current model state and preview their effect on the next model iterations, before applying one of them. This supervised human-in-the-loop process targets maximum improvement for minimum feedback and has proven to be effective in three independent studies that conﬁrm topic model quality improvements.},

The speciﬁcation of the vulnerability characteristics is a crucial procedure, since the characteristics are used as input for a plethora of vulnerability scoring systems. Currently, the determination of the speciﬁc characteristics -that represent each vulnerability- is a process that is performed manually by the IT security experts. However, the vulnerability description can be very informative and useful to predict vulnerability characteristics. The primary goal of this research is the enhancement, the acceleration and the support of the manual procedure of the vulnerability characteristic assignment. To achieve this goal, a model, which combines texts analysis and multi-target classiﬁcation techniques was developed. This model estimates the vulnerability characteristics and subsequently, calculates the vulnerability severity scores from the predicted characteristics. To perform the present research, a dataset that contains 99,091 records from a large -publicly availablevulnerability database was used. The results are encouraging, since they show accuracy in the prediction of the vulnerability characteristics and scores.},

	abstract = {Online product reviews greatly impact sales. Although aggregate data suggests that customers read reviews rather than relying only on summary statistics, little is known about consumers’ review-reading behavior and its impact on conversion at the granular level. To ﬁll this research gap, we analyze a comprehensive dataset that tracks individual-level review reading, search, as well as purchase behaviors, and we achieve two objectives. First, we describe consumers’ review-reading behaviors. In contrast to what has been found with aggregate data, individual level consumer online journey data shows that around 70\% of the time, consumers do not read reviews; they are less likely to read reviews for products that are inexpensive and have many reviews. Second, we quantify the causal impact of quantity and content information of the “read” reviews on sales. The identiﬁcation relies on the variation in the reviews seen by consumers due to newly added reviews. To extract content information, we develop two deep learning models. The full deep learning model predicts conversion directly and the partial deep learning model identiﬁes six dimensions of content in the reviews. The comparative advantage of deep learning models is that they let us sift category-speciﬁc content features across a wide range of product categories without hand-coding features with human intervention or domain knowledge. Across both models, we ﬁnd that aesthetics and price content in the reviews signiﬁcantly affect conversion across a wide range of product categories. Counterfactual simulation suggests that re-ordering review content can have the same effect as a 1.6\% price cut for boosting conversion.},

Given a query, traditional blog sites return a set of conversations often consisting of thousands of comments with complex thread structure. Since the interfaces of these blog sites do not provide any overview of the data, it becomes very difﬁcult for the user to explore and analyze such a large amount of conversational data. In this paper, we present MultiConVis, a visual text analytics system designed to support the exploration of a collection of online conversations. Our system tightly integrates NLP techniques for topic modeling and sentiment analysis with information visualizations, by considering the unique characteristics of online conversations. The resulting interface supports the user exploration, starting from a possibly large set of conversations, then narrowing down to the subset of conversations, and eventually drilling-down to the set of comments of one conversation. Our evaluations through case studies with domain experts and a formal user study with regular blog readers illustrate the potential beneﬁts of our approach, when compared to a traditional blog reading interface.},

Analyzing and gaining insights from such discussions can be quite challenging for a user, especially when the user deals with hundreds of comments that are scattered around multiple different conversations. A promising solution to this problem is to automatically mine the major topics from conversations and organize them into a hierarchical structure. However, the resultant topic hierarchy can be noisy and/or it may not match the user’s current information needs. To address this problem, we introduce a novel human-in-the-loop approach that allows the user to revise the topic hierarchy based on her feedback. We incorporate this approach within a visual text analytics system that helps users in analyzing and getting insights from conversations by exploring and revising the topic hierarchy. We evaluated the resulting system with real users in a lab-based study. The results from the user study, when compared to its counterpart that does not support interactive revisions of a hierarchical topic model, provide empirical evidence of the potential utility of our system in terms of both performance and subjective measures. Finally, we summarize generalizable lessons for introducing human-in-the-loop computation within a visual text analytics system.},

Its architecture brings together techniques from the different areas of signal processing, medical reasoning, knowledge engineering, and natural language generation. A clinical off-ward experiment in a Neonatal ICU (NICU) showed that human expert textual descriptions of NICU data lead to better decision making than classical graphical visualisation, whereas texts generated by BT-45 lead to similar quality decisionmaking as visualisations. Textual analysis showed that BT-45 texts were inferior to human expert texts in a number of ways, including not reporting temporal information as well and not producing good narratives.

	abstract = {We propose an abstraction-based multidocument summarization framework that can construct new sentences by exploring more ﬁne-grained syntactic units than sentences, namely, noun/verb phrases. Different from existing abstraction-based approaches, our method ﬁrst constructs a pool of concepts and facts represented by phrases from the input documents. Then new sentences are generated by selecting and merging informative phrases to maximize the salience of phrases and meanwhile satisfy the sentence construction constraints. We employ integer linear optimization for conducting phrase selection and merging simultaneously in order to achieve the global optimal solution for a summary. Experimental results on the benchmark data set TAC 2011 show that our framework outperforms the state-ofthe-art models under automated pyramid evaluation metric, and achieves reasonably well results on manual linguistic quality evaluation.},

Further progress towards understanding compositionality in tasks such as sentiment detection requires richer supervised training and evaluation resources and more powerful models of composition. To remedy this, we introduce a Sentiment Treebank. It includes ﬁne grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences and presents new challenges for sentiment compositionality. To address them, we introduce the Recursive Neural Tensor Network. When trained on the new treebank, this model outperforms all previous methods on several metrics. It pushes the state of the art in single sentence positive/negative classiﬁcation from 80\% up to 85.4\%. The accuracy of predicting ﬁne-grained sentiment labels for all phrases reaches 80.7\%, an improvement of 9.7\% over bag of features baselines. Lastly, it is the only model that can accurately capture the effects of negation and its scope at various tree levels for both positive and negative phrases.},

In this paper, we are concerned with graph-based algorithms for large-scale WSD. Under this framework, finding the right sense for a given word amounts to identifying the most “important” node among the set of graph nodes representing its senses. We introduce a graph-based WSD algorithm which has few parameters and does not require sense-annotated data for training. Using this algorithm, we investigate several measures of graph connectivity with the aim of identifying those best suited for WSD. We also examine how the chosen lexicon and its connectivity influences WSD performance. We report results on standard data sets and show that our graph-based approach performs comparably to the state of the art.},

Consequently, existing systems are susceptible to the myriad of obfuscation tactics used by fraudsters, resulting in highly ineffective fake website detection performance. In light of these deficiencies, we propose the development of a new class of fake website detection systems that are based on statistical learning theory (SLT). Using a design science approach, a prototype system was developed to demonstrate the potential utility of this class of systems. We conducted a series of experiments, comparing the proposed system against several existing fake website detection systems on a test bed encompassing 900 websites.},

	abstract = {Video sharing social media sites, such as YouTube, that host videos providing information on the pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatments, and prevention of various conditions can be an effective way to understand medical knowledge and in managing chronic conditions through patient self-care. However, due to the heterogeneity of the content quality and content helpfulness on visual social media, healthcare providers and government agencies have expressed concerns about the quality and reliability of such information. There have been relatively few studies that have identified interventions to increase the ease with which patients can find helpful health information. We propose an interdisciplinary lens that synthesizes deep learning methods with themes emphasized in Information Systems (IS) research and research on healthcare informatics. Using a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) method, we extract medical terminology from videos. We annotate videos using inputs from domain experts and build a logistic regression based classifier to categorize videos based on whether they encode a high degree of medical knowledge or not. We identify distinct types of user engagement with videos on YouTube using a principal components analysis (PCA) approach: user dissonance, popularity based engagement, and relevance based engagement. We find that medical knowledge encoded in videos matters to patient engagement; however, popularity-based indicators of engagement indicate that videos that score high on medical knowledge encoded in videos, are actually less popular than those that are not. We conduct robustness checks using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect the presence of medical objects in a video. We find that medical terminology embedded in textual data is more salient to an assessment of medical knowledge encoded in a video, rather than image analytics. Our results suggest that healthcare practitioners and policymakers need a nuanced understanding of how users engage with medical knowledge in video format, which has implications for the role of videos and visual social media in bridging the health literacy gap and in enabling self-care of chronic conditions.},

	abstract = {Word of mouth (WOM) plays an increasingly important role in shaping consumers’ behavior and preferences. In this paper, we examine whether latent personality traits of online users accentuate or attenuate the eﬀectiveness of WOM in social media platforms. To answer this question, we leverage machine-learning methods in combination with econometric techniques utilizing a novel quasi-experiment. Our analysis yields two main results. First, there is a positive and statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect of the level of personality similarity between two social media users on the likelihood of a subsequent purchase from a recipient of a WOM message after exposure to the WOM message of the sender. In particular, exposure to WOM messages from similar users in terms of personality, rather than dissimilar users, increases the likelihood of a postpurchase by 47.58\%. Second, there are statistically signiﬁcant eﬀects of speciﬁc pairwise combinations of personality characteristics of senders and recipients of WOM messages on the eﬀectiveness of WOM. For instance, introverted users are responsive to WOM, in contrast to extroverted users. Besides this, agreeable, conscientious, and open social media users are more eﬀective disseminators of WOM. In addition, WOM originating from users with low levels of emotional range aﬀects similar users, whereas for high levels of emotional range, increased similarity usually has the opposite eﬀect. The examined eﬀects are also of significant economic importance, as, for instance, a WOM message from an extrovert user to an introvert peer increases the likelihood of a subsequent purchase by 71.28\%. Our ﬁndings are robust to several alternative methods and speciﬁcations, such as controlling for latent user homophily and network structure roles based on deep-learning models. By extending the characteristics that have been theorized to aﬀect the eﬀectiveness of WOM from the observable to the latent space, tapping into users’ latent personality characteristics, and illustrating how companies can leverage the abundance of unstructured data in social media, our paper provides actionable insights regarding the future potential of social media advertising and advanced microtargeting based on big data and deep learning.},

However, there are rising concerns about patient privacy in sharing medical and healthcare data. A large amount of these data are in free text form. Existing techniques for privacy-preserving data sharing deal largely with structured data. Current privacy approaches for medical text data focus on detection and removal of patient identiﬁers from the data, which may be inadequate for protecting privacy or preserving data quality. We propose a new systematic approach to extract, cluster, and anonymize medical text records. Our approach integrates methods developed in both data privacy and health informatics ﬁelds. The key novel elements of our approach include a recursive partitioning method to cluster medical text records based on the similarity of the health and medical information and a valueenumeration method to anonymize potentially identifying information in the text data. An experimental study is conducted using real-world medical documents. The results of the experiments demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed approach.},

In contrast to the latter method which stems from linear algebra and performs a Singular Value Decomposition of co-occurrence tables, the proposed technique uses a generative latent class model to perform a probabilistic mixture decomposition. This results in a more principled approach with a solid foundation in statistical inference. More precisely, we propose to make use of a temperature controlled version of the Expectation Maximization algorithm for model ﬁtting, which has shown excellent performance in practice. Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis has many applications, most prominently in information retrieval, natural language processing, machine learning from text, and in related areas. The paper presents perplexity results for different types of text and linguistic data collections and discusses an application in automated document indexing. The experiments indicate substantial and consistent improvements of the probabilistic method over standard Latent Semantic Analysis.},

CMC text analysis relies on systems capable of providing suitable navigation and knowledge discovery functionalities. However, existing CMC systems focus on structural features, with little support for features derived from message text. This deficiency is attributable to the informational richness and representational complexities associated with CMC text. In order to address this shortcoming, we propose a design framework for CMC text analysis systems. Grounded in systemic functional linguistic theory, the proposed framework advocates the development of systems capable of representing the rich array of information types inherent in CMC text. It also provides guidelines regarding the choice of features, feature selection, and visualization techniques that CMC text analysis systems should employ. The CyberGate system was developed as an instantiation of the design framework. CyberGate incorporates a rich feature set and complementary feature selection and visualization methods, including the writeprints and ink blots techniques. An application example was used to illustrate the system's ability to discern important patterns in CMC text. Furthermore, results from numerous experiments conducted in comparison with benchmark methods confirmed the viability of CyberGate's features and techniques. The results revealed that the CyberGate system and its underlying design framework can dramatically improve CMC text analysis capabilities over those provided by existing systems.]},

Due to the increased use of virtual environments, it is now common for team members to examine each other’s profile on a firm’s enterprise social networking site (ESNS) in lieu of an initial face-to-face meeting. This study examines how the information provided in an ESNS impacts impression formation at the initial formation of a virtual team, specifically perceptions of social capital (i.e., relational, structural, and cognitive). To examine social capital perceptions, the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) is utilized to understand how not only information impacts these perceptions but the way in which the user processes information to form the perceptions. Toulmin’s model of argumentation is used in conjunction with ELM to understand the strength of the argument presented. Results suggest that users evaluate ESNS information differently depending on the type of processing (heuristic or systematic) and that these social capital perceptions influence preferences for different team members.},

The system identifies sellers using sentiment analysis of customer reviews and profiles sellers using topic modeling of advertisements. We evaluated the AZSecure system on eight international underground economy forums. The system significantly outperformed all benchmark machine-learning methods on identifying advertisement threads, classifying customer review sentiments, and profiling seller characteristics, with an average F-measure of about 80 percent to 90 percent. In our case study, we identified the famous carder, Rescator, who was affiliated with the Target breach, and captured important seller characteristics in terms of product type, payment options, and contact channels. Our research leverages social media analytics to probe into the underground economy in order to help law enforcement target key sellers and prevent future fraud. It also contributes to our understanding of the use of information technology in detecting deception in online systems.},

While useful, researchers and practitioners have been seeking to develop proactive CTI by better understanding the threats present in hacker communities. This study contributes a novel CTI framework by leveraging an automated and principled web, data, and text mining approach to collect and analyze vast amounts of malicious hacker tools directly from large, international underground hacker communities. By using this framework, we identified many freely available malicious assets such as crypters, keyloggers, web, and database exploits. Some of these tools may have been the cause of recent breaches against organizations such as the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

This analysis identified five core research areas: (1) information technology and organizations; (2) IS development; (3) IT and individuals; (4) IT and markets; and (5) IT and groups. Over the time frame of our analysis, these core topics have remained quite stable. However, the specific research themes within each core area have evolved significantly, reflecting research that has focused less on technology development and more on the social context in which information technologies are designed and used. As such, this analysis demonstrates that the information systems academic discipline has maintained a relatively stable research identity that focuses on how IT systems are developed and how individuals, groups, organizations, and markets interact with IT.]},

Using a field dataset culled from multiple sources, we find that online discussion of distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks in hackforums.net decreases the number of DDOS-attack victims. A 1\% increase in discussion decreases DDOS attacks by 0.032\% to 0.122\%. This means that two DDOS-attack posts per day could reduce the number of victims by 700 to 2,600 per day. We find that discussion topics with similar keywords can variously increase or decrease DDOS attacks, meaning we cannot ascertain the impact of the discussion just by the post nature. Mentioning botnets, especially new botnets, increases the attacks, but the follow-up discussion decreases the attacks. Our results suggest that online-hacker-forum discussion may exhibit the dual-use characteristic. That is, it can be used for both good and bad purposes. We draw related managerial implications.},

We argue for a multiparadigm approach to theory building as a means of establishing correspondence between paradigms and theory-construction efforts. Because of the implications of the multiparadigm approach, we also examine ways of bridging across blurred paradigm boundaries. In addition, we explore a metaparadigm perspective that might allow disparate approaches to theory building to be considered together. Such a perspective can produce views of organizational phenomena that not only allow scholars to recognize inherent and irreconcilable theoretical differences, but also can encourage them to adopt a more comprehensive view by accounting for those differences.},

Drawing on coping theory, we posit that users choose different adaptation strategies based on a combination of primary appraisal (i.e., a user's assessment of the expected consequences of an IT event) and secondary appraisal (i.e., a user's assessment of his/her control over the situation). On that basis, we identify four adaptation strategies (benefits maximizing, benefits satisficing, disturbance handling, and self-preservation) which are hypothesized to result in three different individual-level outcomes: restoring emotional stability, minimizing the perceived threats of the technology, and improving user effectiveness and efficiency. A study of the adaptation behaviors of six account managers in two large North American banks provides preliminary support for our model. By explaining adaptation patterns based on users' initial appraisal and subsequent responses to an IT event, our model offers predictive power while retaining an agency view of user adaptation. Also, by focusing on user cognitive and behavioral adaptation responses related to the technology, the work system, and the self, our model accounts for a wide range of user behaviors such as technology appropriation, avoidance, and resistance.]},

The case study considered in this research is the use of a group support system (GSS) to support employee discussions about gender equity in a university. Transcripts of the four discussions were analyzed using two analysis techniques: a positivist approach, which was focused on the GSS sessions themselves, and an interpretive approach which broadened the scope to include contextual considerations as well. What emerged from the positivist analysis was the conclusion of effective group behavior directed toward consensus around alternative solution scenarios. What emerged from the interpretive analysis was evidence of multiple, rich types of information at three levels: cognitive, affective, and behavioral. The interpretive analysis also uncovered the absence of shared consciousness about the issue and imbalanced participation in the sessions. Comparison of the results of both approaches showed that, while the positivist analysis provided useful information, the interpretive analysis provided a different understanding of the same evidence and new information not found in the positivist analysis of the group discussions. This research adds to the body of knowledge concerning the effects of virtual group meetings on the type of information that is shared and the value of a combination of positivist and interpretive analyses of GSS data.]},

Undoubtedly, part of the problem is that many of the scale development procedures advocated in the literature are limited by the fact that they (1) fail to adequately discuss how to develop appropriate conceptual definitions of the focal construct, (2) often fail to properly specify the measurement model that relates the latent construct to its indicators, and (3) underutilize techniques that provide evidence that the set of items used to represent the focal construct actually measures what it purports to measure. Therefore, the purpose of the present paper is to integrate new and existing techniques into a comprehensive set of recommendations that can be used to give researchers in MIS and the behavioral sciences a framework for developing valid measures. First, we briefly elaborate upon some of the limitations of current scale development practices. Following this, we discuss each of the steps in the scale development process while paying particular attention to the differences that are required when one is attempting to develop scales for constructs with formative indicators as opposed to constructs with reflective indicators. Finally, we discuss several things that should be done after the initial development of a scale to examine its generalizability and to enhance its usefulness.]},

It is argued that the simultaneous research desiderata of data integrity and high currency or generalizability often place conflicting operational demands on researchers. Thus, tradeoffs must be made in employing any method to investigate a research problem. As a consequence of these inevitable tradeoffs, a broader rather than narrower method set becomes appropriate for marketing investigations. Case research is explored as one useful alternative research method for marketers. The nature of case research in contrast to case teaching or prescientific case culling is discussed, the appropriateness of case-based versus more conventional deductive methods is considered by researcher objective and type of problem investigated, and a four-stage case research process is described. General guidelines and caveats for the conduct of marketing case research are given.

	abstract = {Managers and researchers alike suspect that the vast amounts of qualitative information found in blogs, product reviews, real estate listings, news stories, analyst reports and experts’ advice influence consumer behavior. But, do these kinds of qualitative information impact or rather reflect consumer choices? We argue that message content and consumer choice are endogenous, and that non-random selection and the conflation of awareness and persuasion complicate causal estimation of the impact of message content on economic decisions and outcomes. Using data on the transcribed content of 2,397 stock recommendations provided by Jim Cramer on his CNBC show Mad Money from 2005 to 2008, combined with data on Internet search volume, the content of prior news, and prior stock price and trading volume data, we show that selection bias in the stocks Cramer chooses to recommend and prior product awareness on the part of his audience create measurable upward bias in estimates of the impact of Cramer’s advice on stock prices. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to characterize the topical content of Cramer’s speech and the content of prior news, we show that he is less persuasive when he supports his recommendations with arguments that have themselves been recently mentioned in the news. We argue that the classic sales skill of "knowing what a customer needs to hear" can significantly enhance the influence of qualitative information precisely because what the consumer already knows affects how they evaluate messages. The tools and techniques we develop can be put to practical use in a variety of settings where marketers can present subjects with different messages depending on what they already know.},
